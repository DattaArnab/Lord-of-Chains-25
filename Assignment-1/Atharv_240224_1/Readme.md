Objective 1: Proof of Work Blockchain
The code simulates a blockchain using Proof of Work consensus. It features five nodes (Amit, Priya, Rahul, Neha, Vikram) and two miners, with each node having an RSA key pair. Users input sender, recipient, and amount to create transactions, which are signed and verified. Each transaction forms a block with a miner reward, mined with a difficulty of three leading zeros. Balances are calculated from the blockchain by summing transactions. A shared genesis block ensures synchronization, and full outputs display public keys, signatures, and hashes without truncation. The blockchain is printed for each node, showing block details.

Objective 2: Avalanche Consensus
The code simulates the Avalanche consensus mechanism for a transactionâ€™s validity (0 = reject, 1 = accept). It involves configurable nodes (default 10, with Indian names like Amit, Priya) that perform probabilistic sampling across four phases: Slush (majority sampling), Snowflake (consecutive sample confidence), Snowball (state preference), and Avalanche (network agreement). Users input parameters like sample size, quorum threshold, and max rounds. The simulation runs until all nodes agree for two rounds, displaying detailed node states and sampling results without truncation. No blockchain structure is included, focusing solely on consensus.
